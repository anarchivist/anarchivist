### Hello! 👋🏽

I'm an archivist, technologist, and [ambient musician](https://blacktent.bandcamp.com/). I work as an engineering manager and digital strategist, and professionally, I still identify as an archivist and an information scientist.

I have also worked on a number of open source or community projects in the cultural heritage technology space, including **[@projectblacklight](https://github.com/)**, **[@IIIF](https://github.com/iiif)**, **[@projectmirador](https://github.com/projectmirador)**, and **[@rightsstatements](https://github.com/rightsstatements)**.

I write about my work and interests, as well as cooking and hobby adventures, on [my website](https://matienzo.org/).
